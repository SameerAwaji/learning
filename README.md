I have no Idea what is this doing

hi,
just finished the last exam yesterday in forth semester, "really hoping the grades are well" and I have been thinking about learning front-end, but I don't know if this
is a good thing to learn because I am studying software engineering and may be front-end is not the road.

tried to find out about what software engineers do, but I couldn't figure it out.
I guess I will go with it and then I'll think about the uni.
